# Birthday Problem: Simulation & Paradox

## Abstract üßê

The "Birthday Problem" (or Birthday Paradox) explores a surprisingly counterintuitive statistical phenomenon: in a group of people, what's the minimum number needed such that there's a greater than 50% chance that at least two individuals share the same birthday? This project provides a Python-based exploration, demonstrating that this number is much smaller than many initially expect‚Äîjust 23 people! The script simulates this scenario, calculates the theoretical probabilities, and visualizes the results.

## Project Overview üíª

This Python script offers a hands-on way to understand the Birthday Problem by:

* **Simulating** the scenario using a Monte Carlo method to empirically estimate the probabilities.
* **Calculating** the exact theoretical probabilities for comparison.
* **Plotting** both simulated and theoretical results on a single graph.
* **Highlighting** the critical point where the probability of a shared birthday surpasses 50%.

## How the Code Works ‚öôÔ∏è

The script is primarily built around three functions:

1.  `simulate_birthday_problem(trials, group_size_limit)`: Runs random birthday assignments for various group sizes over many trials to find the empirical probability of shared birthdays.
2.  `calculate_theoretical_probabilites(group_size_limit)`: Computes the exact mathematical probability of at least one shared birthday for each group size using the complementary probability (1 - P(all birthdays are different)).
3.  `main()`: Orchestrates the simulation and theoretical calculations, then uses Matplotlib to generate a comparative plot, annotating the 50% threshold.

## Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

* Python 3.x
* NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
* Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)

## How to Run üöÄ

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `birthday_paradox.py`).
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4.  Execute the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Expected Output üìä

Running the script will display a Matplotlib window showing a plot with:
* The number of people in a group on the x-axis.
* The probability of at least two people sharing a birthday on the y-axis.
* Lines representing both the simulated and theoretical probabilities.
* Annotations indicating when the 50% probability mark is crossed.
